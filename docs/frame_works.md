Introduction to Web Frameworks
------------------------------
Web frameworks are software frameworks designed to aid the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. They provide a structure and set of tools to simplify common web development tasks, making it easier for developers to build robust and scalable web applications.

# Popular Python Web Frameworks
1) Django:
    - Description: Django is a high-level, batteries-included web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It includes an ORM for database operations, an admin interface, and follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
    - Key Features:
        - Built-in admin panel.
        - ORM for database operations.
        - URL routing.
        - Templating engine.
        - Authentication system
2) Flask:
    - Description: Flask is a lightweight and modular micro-framework. It provides the essentials to get a web application up and running, allowing developers to choose additional components based on their needs. Flask is often referred to as a "micro-framework" because it is minimalistic and does not impose a specific project structure.
    - Key Features:
        - Simple and easy to use.
        - Extensible with various extensions.
        - No built-in ORM (can be added with extensions).
        - Good for small to medium-sized projects.

3) FastAPI:
    - Description: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, while also providing automatic documentation generation.
    - Key Features:
        - Automatic data validation and serialization.
        - Dependency injection system.
        - Asynchronous support using Python's async and await.

5. Tornado:
    - Description: Tornado is a scalable, non-blocking web server and web application framework designed to handle asynchronous tasks. It is well-suited for applications requiring real-time updates and long-lived connections.
    - Key Features:
        - Asynchronous support.
        - WebSockets and long polling.
        - Suitable for handling large numbers of simultaneous connections.
